# Gitlab Releases Filter

## Quick Start

## Motivation

This project was started because there's no option to filter the relevant information to a particular Mode or Tier of gitlab instalation on the release pages, with this it's easier to read only the relevant features to your gitlab installation.

## Team

This is a project done in my free time to fix an issue that was bothering me a bit, if anyone wants to fork or contribute to this project you are welcome to do it.

## Tech Stack

This was created as a React App to be able to make this a quick and dirty win.
